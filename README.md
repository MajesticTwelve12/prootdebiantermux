# Proot Debian Installation Script - Work In Progress. DO NOT USE

- This script is based off of DroidMaster's proot installation guide, but in a script.
https://github.com/LinuxDroidMaster/Termux-Desktops/blob/main/Documentation/proot/debian_proot.md

proot debian installation with termux, work in progress. Please do not use unless for debugging purposes.

### TODOs

1. Splitting files into two parts so one can be run inside proot-distro so the user does not have to type in commands for sudoers file and other programs that are needed to be installed

2. Using the nightly builds from Termux X11 application from github. (https://github.com/termux/termux-x11/releases/tag/nightly)

3. More documentation on the code and so users understand what it does and why it needs to be done so it works as intended... (over documentation is my favourite)


- Honorable mention to @polkaulfield 's Ubuntu debullshit script as a template because I cannot program much without a reference!

Feel free to make pull requests to make this small project of mine a little bit better! Even if they are small little mistakes!
